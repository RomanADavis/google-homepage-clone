# google-homepage-clone

Hi. I made this project at the request of Sensegrass HR, as a test for a remote job. Feel feel to open up an issue and tell me what you think.

As part of the test, I had to host it on Heroku, which is why this project contains a little bit of PHP. Currently, this site is hosted at http://tranquil-sierra-55709.herokuapp.com/.
